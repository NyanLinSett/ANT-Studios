                <p style="text-indent: 30px; text-align: justify; font-family: Coolvetica; width: 60%; font-size: large; color: black;"> When you do that though, the main point is by analyzing how their body movement is and how their speech is. Where do they emphasize their words, how do they capture viewers' attention, which parts did you like best about them? Take note of these and apply them slowly and slowly when you speak. </p>

                <p style="text-indent: 30px; text-align: justify; font-family: Coolvetica; width: 60%; font-size: large; color: black;"> The most effective and essential thing, of course, is to simply speak and talk in the language you want to master speaking. If you don't try, nothing will improve. You can listen to tens of lectures, hundreds of songs and movies, know thousands of words and if you don't speak, you will not improve speaking. Remember, to be able to speak well, you must speak first.
